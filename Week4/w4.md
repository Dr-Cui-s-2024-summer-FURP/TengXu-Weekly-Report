- Main problem met: 
    1. The surface material of the model was displaying an incorrect red colour due to an unknown reason.

    2. The fps of the IS was unexpectedly low, and it was really hard to operate the software after start playing the model. 
- Solution of the problem: 
    1. After deleting a LiDAR model and restart the IS, the material returned to its original apprence. 
- The [.usd file](/Week4/result/Project.usd) has been uploaded in [/result](/Week4/result/) fold.

## 2. PoseCNN & PointNet: 
- Kept reviewing the concepts and projects of PoseCNN and PointNet

## 3. Future Goal for Next Week
- Finish all setup of cameras and LiDARs
- Start data simulation and collection
- Keep reviewing and learning IS, CNN & PointNet
