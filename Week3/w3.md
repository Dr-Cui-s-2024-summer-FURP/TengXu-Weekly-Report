# Week 3 Work & Goal

## 1. CNN Study
- PoseCNN:  
    - Review the basic concepts of PoseCNN
    - Studied related PoseCNN project:
        - [PoseCNN-PyTorch: A PyTorch Implementation of the PoseCNN Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation](https://github.com/NVlabs/PoseCNN-PyTorch)
        - Progress of the project:
            - Installation finished successfully (last week).
            - Running own Project:  
            **Failed** due to incomplete data.
            **Training and testing on the DexYCB dataset**  
                1. Created a symlink to the data: 
                    ```
                    cd $ROOT/data/DEX_YCB
                    ln -s $dex_ycb_data data
                    ```
                2. Run the project with bellow running code: 
                    ```
                    cd $ROOT

                    # multi-gpu training for different splits, use 1 GPU or 2 GPUs since batch size is set to 2
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_train_s0.sh
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_train_s1.sh
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_train_s2.sh
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_train_s3.sh

                    # testing, $GPU_ID can be 0, 1, etc.
                    # our trained models are in checkpoints.zip
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_test_s0.sh $GPU_ID $EPOCH
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_test_s1.sh $GPU_ID $EPOCH
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_test_s2.sh $GPU_ID $EPOCH
                    ./experiments/scripts/dex_ycb_test_s3.sh $GPU_ID $EPOCH

                    ```
            - Result of the project: 
                **Failed** due to **incomplete and not accessable data source**
            
        - Main difficulties met: 
            1. The project was too old and relied on database versions that did not correspond, making training and testing impossible.
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week3/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-22 161259.png" alt="Difficult1" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
            2. The project is so old that many of the data sources and links are broken or failing, and the background data for the operational requirements of the project are no longer available but still needed by the project, making it impossible to continue the project.
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week3/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-22 163045.png" alt="Difficult2" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
        - Solutions of these difficulties: 
            1. Related library fixes to some scripts to fix most compatibility issues (similar to previous solutions)
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week3/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-22 161246.png" alt="Solution1" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
            2. Difficulties could not be corrected due to problems with the data source, and the project replication failed and ended. :(
