# Week 2 Work & Goal

## 1. CNN Study
- PoseCNN: 
    - Studied basic concepts of PoseCNN:
        - Related video about PoseCNN: [【网课视频】PoseCNN](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1r54y1Q7Ho/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=26624f082cfd70a54f6c219c28209c17) from Bilibili
    - Studied related PoseCNN project:
        - [PoseCNN-PyTorch: A PyTorch Implementation of the PoseCNN Framework for 6D Object Pose Estimation](https://github.com/NVlabs/PoseCNN-PyTorch)
        - Introduction: 
            > PoseCNN is an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network for 6D object pose estimation. PoseCNN estimates the 3D translation of an object by localizing its center in the image and predicting its distance from the camera. The 3D rotation of the object is estimated by regressing to a quaternion representation. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00199), [Project](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/).  
            > Rotation regression in PoseCNN cannot handle symmetric objects very well. Check [PoseRBPF](https://github.com/NVlabs/PoseRBPF) for a better solution for symmetric objects.  
            > The code also supports pose refinement by matching segmented 3D point cloud of an object to its SDF.

        - Progress of the project:
            - Installation finished successfully.
            - Demo running: faild cause that the demo data is notavailable (Google Drive file not found)
            - Running own Project: ready with all required data was downloaded, will finish this next week
        - Main difficlties met:
            1. Couldn't install requirement due to the unsupported version of opencv-python
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-06-30 161225.png" alt="Difficult1" style="width:45%;">
                </div>
            2. Couldn't initialize the torch module in sudo environment while initialisation in pip defult environment is available
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-06-30 235748.png" alt="Difficult2" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
            3. Couldn't find the THC.h document to run the "setup.py" document
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-01 012127.png" alt="Difficult3" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
        - Solutions of these difficulties: 
            1. Change the requirement.txt to set the latest opencv-python
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-06-30 163529.png" alt="Solution1" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
            2. Reinstall the PyTorch in sudo environment (so that there are 2 environments on the Linux)  
                (Shown on bottom of the picture Difficulty2)  
            3. According to this [website](https://blog.csdn.net/programmer_A/article/details/136539319) , due to the update of the PyTorch, the torch delete the support of THC.h and change to another way to access and manage CUDA. Thsu modified the document "ROIAlign_cuda.cu" to make it accessable to the latest version of PyTorch

    - Studied related PointNet project:
        - [Pytorch Implementation of PointNet and PointNet++](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch)
        - Introduction: 
            > This repo is implementation for [PointNet](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Qi_PointNet_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) and [PointNet++](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7095-pointnet-deep-hierarchical-feature-learning-on-point-sets-in-a-metric-space.pdf) in pytorch.
        - Progress of the project:
            - Installation finished successfully.
            - Demo running:
                - Classification (ModelNet10/40): 
                3 running modes were set: 
                    - The 1st mode, **ModelNet40, pointnet2_ssg without normal features**, was finished successfully for about **11 hours 20 minutes**. 
                    - The 2nd mode, **ModelNet40, pointnet2_ssg with normal featurs**, was finished successfully for about **11 hours 30 minutes**.
                    - ~~The Original 3rd mode, **ModelNet40, pointnet2_ssg with uniform sampling**, was **deleted** because it takes too much time.~~
                    - The 3rd mode, **ModelNet10, pointnet2_ssg without normal features**, was finished successfully for about **5 hours**.  

                    With defult running code for these modes: 


                        # ModelNet40
                        ## Select different models in ./models 

                        ## e.g., pointnet2_ssg without normal features
                        sudo python train_classification.py --model pointnet2_cls_ssg --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg
                        sudo python test_classification.py --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg

                        ## e.g., pointnet2_ssg with normal features
                        sudo python train_classification.py --model pointnet2_cls_ssg --use_normals --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg_normal
                        sudo python test_classification.py --use_normals --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg_normal

                        ## e.g., pointnet2_ssg with uniform sampling, this mode is deleted and will not be run
                        ## sudo python train_classification.py --model pointnet2_cls_ssg --use_uniform_sample --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg_fps
                        ## sudo python test_classification.py --use_uniform_sample --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg_fps

                        # ModelNet10
                        ## Similar setting like ModelNet40, just using --num_category 10

                        ## e.g., pointnet2_ssg without normal features
                        sudo python train_classification.py --model pointnet2_cls_ssg_10 --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg --num_category 10
                        sudo python test_classification.py --log_dir pointnet2_cls_ssg_10 --num_category 10

                    Running finished successfully for about **3 minutes**, with given pretrain model and running code bellow:  

                        ## Check model in ./models 
                        ## e.g., pointnet2_msg, train cancled with pretrain data cause the traning takes too much time
                        ## sudo python train_partseg.py --model pointnet2_part_seg_msg --normal --log_dir pointnet2_part_seg_msg
                        sudo python test_partseg.py --normal --log_dir pointnet2_part_seg_msg

        - Main difficlties met:
            - Download training data failed with defult network environment.
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-01 122926.png" alt="Difficult4" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
            - Couldn't open the download link for S3DIS files.

                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-01 153318.png" alt="Difficult5" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
            - Some of the demo runnings take too much time to finish, eg, the Original mode 3 of classification.  
                <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="/Week2/pic/屏幕截图 2024-07-02 161722.png" alt="Difficult6" style="width:55%;">
                </div>
        - Solutions of these difficulties:
            - Connect with a VPN to USA to download the training data.  
                > For some reason this solution should not be shown.
            - Searching for the online copy of S3DIS file on this [website](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43486780/article/details/116642427) and download from another source through this [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BtDCIDYEbILDWms1__9tpw) with passcode **0acs**.

                </div>
            - Deleted the unnecessary process of the demo running to reduce workload.

## 2. Reason for absence of weekly meetings:

I'm really sorry for the absence pf the meetings, because that my home is far away from the school and it is unacceptable for my family to travel to Ningbo every week, with stay application not available anymore. So it also means that I might won't attend the meetings in the future either. I make sure I can sync progress and upload results weekly via GitHub, and I will try my best to catch up with the group as quickly as possible.

---
## 3. Future Goal for Next Week:
- Try to get the demo data of PoseCNN Project and run the demo
- Try to run the own result in "Training and testing on the DexYCB dataset" part
